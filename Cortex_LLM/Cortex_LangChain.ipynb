For example, a semantic search engine might understand that \"Apple\" can refer to the fruit or the technology company, and it will return results accordingly based on the context of the search query.\\n\\nSemantic search is becoming increasingly important in today\\'s digital world, where the amount of information available online is growing exponentially. Semantic search helps users find the information they are looking for more quickly and accurately, and it can also improve the user experience by providing more relevant and personalized results.'"
