    "## RAG Evaluation with Snowflake Cortex\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Snowflake Cortex to generate synthetic questions and answers for evaluating a RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks is based on the [Hugging Face RAG evaluation notebook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/rag_evaluation), but using Cortex to generate the synthetic questions and answers and performing the operations in Snowpark (and not on the local machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main steps in this notebook:\n",
    "-   **Step 1**: Generating Synthetic Questions and Answers\n",
    "-   **Step 2**: Evaluating Synthetic Questions for Groundness, Relevance, and Context\n",
    "-   **Step 3**: Getting Predictions for Synthetic Questions\n",
    "-   **Step 4**: Evaluating Performance on Synthetic Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses `mixtral-8x7b` for generarting questions/answers and `mistral-large` for the final evaluation on the synthetic questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to evaluate a RAG model, and this notebook is just one example. The evaluation metrics used in this notebook are not exhaustive, and you may want to consider additional metrics when evaluating your RAG model. This notebook was put together for one project, so plenty of room for improvement and customization."
