    "# Forecasting with Snowflake Cortex ML-Based Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most critical activities that a Data/Business Analyst has to perform is to produce recommendations to their business stakeholders based upon the insights they have gleaned from their data. In practice, this means that they are often required to build models to: make forecasts. However, Analysts are often impeded from creating the best models possible due to the depth of statistical and machine learning knowledge required to implement them in practice. Further, python or other programming frameworks may be unfamiliar to Analysts who write SQL, and the nuances of fine-tuning a model may require expert knowledge that may be out of reach. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these use cases, Snowflake has developed a set of SQL based ML Functions, that implement machine learning models on the user's behalf. As of December 2023, three ML Functions are available for time-series based data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forecasting: which enables users to forecast a metric based on past values. Common use-cases for forecasting including predicting future sales, demand for particular sku's of an item, or volume of traffic into a website over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further details on ML Functions, please refer to the [snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/guides-overview-analysis). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Working knowledge of SQL\n",
    "- A Snowflake account login with an ACCOUNTADMIN role. If not, you will need to use a different role that has the ability to create database, schema, table, stages, tasks, email integrations, and stored procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Youâ€™ll Learn \n",
    "- How to make use of Forecasting ML Function to create models \n",

    "This is a notebook written using Snowflake notebooks, to use outside of Snowflake, you will need to connect to the Snowflake instance (see my other notebooks for that)"

The forecasting ML function is smart enough to be able to automatically identify and handle multiple seasonality patterns, so we will go ahead and use the latest year's worth of data as input to our model.
